# Market Regime Detection using Machine Learning

## Description
Develop a framework for detecting market regime shifts using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

### Key Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from financial APIs.
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) and classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- Visualization of regime shifts and model performance.

### Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Datasets

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle:
