# Market Regime Detection using Machine Learning

## Description
This project involves developing a framework for detecting market regime shifts using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The framework includes data collection and preprocessing, implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN), and classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest), and visualization of regime shifts and model performance.

## Key Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from financial APIs.
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) and classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- Visualization of regime shifts and model performance.

## Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
